# Magical Arena Game

Welcome to the Magical Arena game! This simple Java application simulates battles between players in a magical arena.

## Project Structure

This project follows a well-organized structure with two main packages:

1. **util Package**: Think of it as a toolbox. It contains a special tool called the `Dice` class, which helps the program simulate dice rolls. Just imagine it as a virtual dice for the project.

2. **playermanagement Package**: This is like the control center. It contains classes that handle battles and take care of everything related to players. There's also a class specifically for players. So, it's where the game manages all things player-related.

3. **Magical Arena Class**: This is like the brain of the project. It's called `MagicalArena`, and it's where everything starts. It's where the program kicks off and makes things happen.
